                        Collecting and Distributing Zakathul Fitr rice from people who are strong enough to provide 
                        meal for themselves to the needy who are struggling to make their way of life. We have been 
                        collecting the rices from different areas and people as that is an obligation of each who are 
                        strong in wealth. Then we do distribute the collected rice among the needy around gothatuwa 
                        by carefully measuring their status and wealth so that the contribution of those who gave has 
                        been ended on the needed hands. With the help of ALLAH we have been doing this worthy cause for 
                        the second time and we hope to continue this process and ease the burden of the community.
